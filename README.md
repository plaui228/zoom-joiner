# zoom-joiner
this program is very customizable and useful for those who are teaching or learning on zoom.

to customize the links just open the links.txt file and customize to all your needs,
the examples are provided within the file so you dont have to understand python to
customize the file :)

if you are a teacher then you can customize the links in the links.txt file and send
that customized file to your class, all they need to do is interchange the file and
it will be working fine.

if something does not work or some problems arise write them into this scripts
